-> Database is a collection of related data and data is a collection of facts and figures that can be processed to produce information. 

-> Mostly data represents recordable facts. 
-> Data aids in producing information, which is based on facts. For example, if we have data about marks obtained by all students, 
    we can then conclude about toppers and average marks.

-> A database management system stores data in such a way that it becomes easier to retrieve, manipulate, and produce information.




Characteristics:

-> Traditionally, data was organized in file formats. 
-> DBMS was a new concept then,and all the research was done to make it overcome the deficiencies in traditional style of data management. 


-> A modern DBMS has the following characteristics:

 Real-world entity: 
-> A modern DBMS is more realistic and uses real-world entities to design its architecture. 
-> It uses the behavior and attributes too. 
-> For example, a school database may use students as an entity and their age as an attribute.


 Relation-based tables: 
-> DBMS allows entities and relations among them to form tables. 
-> A user can understand the architecture of a database just by looking at the table names.


 Isolation of data and application: 
-> A database system is entirely different than its data. 
-> A database is an active entity, whereas data is said to be passive, on which the database works and organizes. 
-> DBMS also stores metadata, which is data about data, to ease its own process.


 Less redundancy: DBMS follows the rules of normalization, which splits 
a relation when any of its attributes is having redundancy in values. 
Normalization is a mathematically rich and scientific process that reduces 
data redundancy
